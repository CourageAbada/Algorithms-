# Algorithms-
Bubble Sort
This program demonstrates how to sort an array of strings in alphabetical order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.

Getting Started
To get started with the program, clone the repository to your local machine and run the BubbleSort.java file in your preferred IDE. The program can also be compiled and run using the command line.

Prerequisites
To compile and run the program, you need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer.

Installing
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository-name>.git
Open the BubbleSort.java file in your preferred IDE.

Running the Program
Compile the program using the command:

Copy code
javac BubbleSort.java
Run the program using the command:

Copy code
java BubbleSort
The program will output the sorted list of strings in the console.

How it Works
The program uses the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an array of strings in alphabetical order. The algorithm works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order until the entire list is sorted.

The program creates an array of strings and then uses two nested for loops to compare adjacent strings and swap them if necessary. The outer loop controls the number of passes over the array, while the inner loop compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

The program prints the sorted list of strings to the console.

Quick Sort
This program demonstrates how to sort an array of integers using the Quick Sort algorithm.

Getting Started
To get started with the program, clone the repository to your local machine and run the QuickSort.java file in your preferred IDE. The program can also be compiled and run using the command line.

Prerequisites
To compile and run the program, you need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer.

Installing
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository-name>.git
Open the QuickSort.java file in your preferred IDE.

Running the Program
Compile the program using the command:

Copy code
javac QuickSort.java
Run the program using the command:

Copy code
java QuickSort
The program will output the sorted list of integers in the console.

How it Works
The program uses the Quick Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers. The algorithm works by selecting a pivot element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

The program creates an array of integers and then recursively partitions the array into two sub-arrays using the partition() function until the entire array is sorted. The partition() function takes the last element of the array as the pivot, and then moves all elements smaller than the pivot to the left of it and all elements greater than the pivot to the right of it.

The program prints the sorted array of integers to the console using the printArray() function.
